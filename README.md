# Module Project: Redux - Car Sales

In this project you are given the skeleton/structure/styling of a React app. There is even some state built in for you. Your job will be to implement React-Redux as the state management system for this application.

## Introduction
# _Project - Car Sales_

- This is a really fun project, and one to show your family and friends when you've finished.
- You will be starting with a structured and styled app
- You have been commissioned to implement Redux as the state management system in this app
- You have the freedom to manage the state how you would like - ie, connecting multiple components to pass data directly to them, or maybe connecting one component, and then putting the data into a context object.

## Instructions

### _MVP Requirements:_

**Step 1 - Planning 📝**

- Take a good amount of time to familiarize yourself with the project structure. Figure out what data you have and where it's being used (Pen and paper or a whiteboard will be your best friend here!)
- Plan out your state management structure as mentioned above. The only requirment is that you _must_ use Redux
- Write out the steps you think you'll need to complete this project. It seems silly, but doing this with every project will help you grow into a better developer a lot faster.
- Take note of the few comments throughout the app. They are there as little guides to nudge you in the right direction. You're welcome 😉

**Step 2 - And... Action! 🎬**

- Time to get your hands on your keyboard. Look at the first step you wrote down and start implementing!
- As you work through setting up redux, you can do it however you'd like. This is the flow that works for me:

```text
Set up "empty" reducer and initial state 👉 Set up store and Provider 👉
Connect components 👉 Add events and event handlers in UI 👉 Build action creators 👉
write the reducer logic for the actions 👉 Rinse and repeat
```

#### _MVP Requirements:_

- Move the given state to the reducer as the initial state for the Redux store.
- Set up the Redux flow
- User should be able to add features to their car
- User should be able to remove added features from their car
- Total should update as user adds and removes features from their car
